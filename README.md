# Draughts
Draughts game to play in a console for 2 players.

# Description
Game was designed for 2 players in a console. First of all we have to choose names for both players. Then we can see the board, current score, and instructions for making moves.  
Moves are made by pointing two coordinates on the board, which are seperated by single space. First coordinate refers to pawn that we want to move, second indicates cell on the board on which we want to place this pawn.
If we provide incorrect coordinates, program will show an error and we will have to try again.  

Along with general score players can get combo points for beating few pawns in one turn. If we beat single pawn, we are allowed to make another move up to the point when we don't beat any of enemies pawns.  
When one of the players is out of pawns, than the game is over and program shows winners name and his final score.
